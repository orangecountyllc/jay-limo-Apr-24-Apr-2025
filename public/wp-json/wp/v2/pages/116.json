Mike, a mechanic, looks after the cars, and George who has always been entrepreneurial, takes care of the day-to-day business, including driving and taking bookings.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe company operates primarily in the wedding and leisure markets. Leisure tour itineraries are created using guidebooks, a wall map of Scotland and a roller to estimate mileage. There\u2019s no way to contact the chauffeurs while away on tour, so stringent pre-planning is a necessity.  <br \/>\r\n\n            <\/div>\n\n            \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n\n        <div class=\"col-2\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\">\n\n                                          <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/assets\/uploads\/2023\/08\/history-1-1-812x575.jpg\" data-aos=\"bg-image-fade-in\" alt=\"\">\n                          \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n          <div\n        class=\"grid-container  lightGrid  site-container  reverse \">\n\n        <div class=\"col-1\">\n          <div class=\"cta\">\n            <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\">Expansion<\/h2>\n            <div class=\"wysywig\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n              In the late 70s, George is one of the founding members of the \u201cInternational Limousine Association\u201d and the growth of Little\u2019s worldwide service is boosted by forming partnerships with like-minded chauffeur drive companies across the globe. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the 1980s the business is growing at a steady pace. With 10 cars on the fleet, Little\u2019s requires a new premises, and the company moves operations to a large garage and shop front on Paisley Road West, Glasgow \u2013 where Little\u2019s is headquartered to this day. The growth of ship building, whisky and financial services in Scotland creates a much greater demand for corporate chauffeur drive services, and additional premises in Edinburgh are secured to enable coverage of the whole of Scotland. <br \/>\r\n\n            <\/div>\n\n            \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n\n        <div class=\"col-2\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\">\n\n                                          <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/assets\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Screenshot-2023-08-25-at-12.51.43-812x575.png\" data-aos=\"bg-image-fade-in\" alt=\"\">\n                          \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n          <div\n        class=\"grid-container  lightGrid  site-container \">\n\n        <div class=\"col-1\">\n          <div class=\"cta\">\n            <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\">The Next Generation<\/h2>\n            <div class=\"wysywig\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n              Heather, like many children of family business owners, starts working in the business with no real ambition of staying long-term. During her postgraduate degree she studies some elements of marketing and subsequently her father, George, asks her to complete a six-month placement to assist with marketing Little\u2019s to financial services clients from London. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis activity is extremely successful and sets the business up for a significant jump in growth during the 90s. This is when Heather decides to join the family business on a permanent basis, being made partner in 1997. As her parents approach retirement age, a carefully planned succession is executed, and Heather becomes Managing Director in 2005.<br \/>\r\n\n            <\/div>\n\n            \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n\n        <div class=\"col-2\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\">\n\n                                          <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/assets\/uploads\/2023\/08\/history-3-812x575.jpg\" data-aos=\"bg-image-fade-in\" alt=\"\">\n                          \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n          <div\n        class=\"grid-container  lightGrid  site-container  reverse \">\n\n        <div class=\"col-1\">\n          <div class=\"cta\">\n            <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\">Overcoming Adversity<\/h2>\n            <div class=\"wysywig\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n              Little\u2019s weathers many a storm over the years, including the Gulf War and two financial crashes. But these events pale into comparison to the impact that COVID-19 has on the company. Having looked at every opportunity to pivot the business and remain operational, in late 2020 Heather makes the decision to put Little\u2019s into a financial coma to ensure there is still a viable business when the worst of the pandemic is over.<br \/>\r\n <br \/>\r\nWhen the team finally come back from furlough, the borders open, and people start to travel again, it is COP26, the major climate conference in Glasgow, that presents Little\u2019s with an opportunity to come back strong. COP26 is the biggest event ever to take place in Scotland and Little\u2019s must quickly scale up from \u201chaving hardly turned a wheel for a year\u201d to employing 140 additional chauffeurs, adding the same number of vehicles to the fleet, and delivering over 300 hires a day. The event not only ensures that Little\u2019s survive as a business, but are able to truly thrive again.\n            <\/div>\n\n            \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n\n        <div class=\"col-2\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\">\n\n                                          <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/assets\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Chanel-Event-812x575.jpg\" data-aos=\"bg-image-fade-in\" alt=\"\">\n                          \n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n          <div\n        class=\"grid-container  lightGrid  site-container \">\n\n        <div class=\"col-1\">\n          <div class=\"cta\">\n            <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\">Little\u2019s Today<\/h2>\n            <div class=\"wysywig\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n              Little\u2019s come back stronger than ever before, with individuals and agents in the corporate, entertainment, events and clinical trials industries using their services globally. The Leisure Tours division experiences exponential growth, almost doubling in size from pre-COVID levels. A team of over 70 employees operates the business across head office and chauffeuring teams and post COVID figures are the strongest in the company\u2019s 55+ year history. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n2023 also sees the expansion and restructure of the leadership team, giving Little\u2019s the strong foundations needed to support significant and ambitious growth plans for the next five years and beyond.
