Here is our (by no means extensive) list:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. The Autumnal Atmosphere<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something Scotland is known for is its greenery and this means that it wears the changing colours of autumn so well. Just imagine it: the leaves popping yellow and amber and fiery red, the setting sun casting its golden-hour light on everything. Even when the sun isn\u2019t shining, there is a certain charm to Scotland\u2019s hills when they\u2019re cloaked in mist, and something so cosy about sitting around a roaring fireplace with a warming drink when the rain is coming down outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. A More Reasonable Budget<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most hotels and attractions need to inflate their prices during the summer months to get the most out of the busier season. At&nbsp;<em>Little\u2019s<\/em>&nbsp;our rates remain consistent throughout the year, so you will be able to enjoy more for your money by travelling later in the year with hotel rooms being cheaper and entry to exhibits being more reasonably priced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. The Seasonal Food<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the finest restaurants in Scotland crafting their menus around seasonal produce, you can expect to enjoy some of the most delicious food in the autumn. Root vegetables that comprise so many traditional Scottish recipes are plentiful and native Scottish oysters are perfect at this time of year too, not to mention seasonal fruits that make for delicious jams and crumbles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. A Perfect Time for Wildlife Lovers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Autumn is one of the best seasons for spotting Scotland\u2019s wildlife, from squirrels and rare migrant birds to stags and seals and dolphins. The early autumn is also when you\u2019ll be able to see Scotland\u2019s native Atlantic salmon leaping upstream which is a sight to behold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Miss the Crowds and See More<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With \u2018over-tourism\u2019 being a real problem in some of the most popular areas in Scotland, travelling off-season means that not only will you be a more sustainable traveller (something we are passionate about at&nbsp;<em>Little\u2019s<\/em>), but you\u2019ll also get to see more and have a more authentic experience. For instance, if you choose to visit locations such as Edinburgh or the iconic Isle of Skye during one of our tours, you will have more space to wander and explore without needing to navigate around throngs of tourists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about our tours, click&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/touring\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"120\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/news\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"105\">Back to News<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scotland Awaits Your Arrival.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":323,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[40,45,39,41,44,42,46,43],"class_list":["post-316","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","tag-best-time-to-visit-scotland","tag-edinburgh-in-autumn","tag-scotland-autumn-attractions","tag-scotland-fall","tag-scotland-scenic-dives-autumn","tag-scotland-wildlife-in-autumn","tag-scottish-culture-in-fall","tag-things-to-do-in-scotland-in-fall"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.8 -
