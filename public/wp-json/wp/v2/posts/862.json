The crisp air, twinkling lights, and festive cheer that fills the streets makes it the perfect winter escape. Anyone who knows me will tell you that Christmas is my absolute favourite time of year. As a Christmas enthusiast, I love experiencing all the best seasonal spots \u2013 and I\u2019ve picked out a few of my favourites to share with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:18px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"690\" src=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/pictures-1024x690.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-867\" srcset=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/pictures-1024x690.png 1024w, https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/pictures-300x202.png 300w, https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/pictures-768x517.png 768w, https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/pictures-1536x1035.png 1536w, https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/pictures.png 1685w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:18px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Edinburgh Christmas Markets<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s not to love about the Edinburgh Christmas Markets? These lively stalls, set against the stunning backdrop of Edinburgh Castle, create a true festive picture. Wrapping up warm and wandering through the market, you\u2019ll discover everything from unique artisan crafts to tempting food stalls. Bailey\u2019s hot chocolate is a personal favourite, and I highly recommend trying a delicious crepe to keep warm. And if you\u2019re in the mood for some fun, the rides and ice skating are a must! It\u2019s a day out that promises enjoyment for all ages \u2013 and with free entry, it\u2019s easy to swing by for a quick visit or to make a full day of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:18px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Candlelit Christmas Concerts<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, I attended my first Christmas candlelit concert, and it might just become a new tradition. Picture this: a string quartet playing classic Christmas carols in a room illuminated by the warm glow of candles. The atmosphere is calming, and the ban on phones (until the end) lets you fully immerse yourself in the moment. These concerts offer a delightful escape from the hustle and bustle of the festive season, providing a chance to pause, breathe, and savour the music without distractions. It\u2019s like stepping into a peaceful winter\u2019s night, even amidst the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:18px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Silverbirch Garden Centre<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re dreaming of stepping into a Hallmark Christmas movie, then Silverbirch Garden Centre in Clyde Valley is the place to be. This is no ordinary garden centre \u2013 it\u2019s a Christmas wonderland! Every room is carefully curated with luxurious decorations and festive homeware, with each space presenting a different theme. After exploring the festive displays, you can indulge in a wholesome lunch at their caf\u00e9, followed by a baked treat and a hot drink. There\u2019s nothing quite like sipping a steaming mug of tea or coffee while surrounded by twinkling lights and holiday cheer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:18px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Christmas Shopping: St James Quarter &amp; Buchanan Street<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>No festive season is complete without a day of Christmas shopping, and Edinburgh\u2019s St James Quarter and Glasgow\u2019s Buchanan Street are two of the best places to check off your list. St James Quarter is an absolute haven for shoppers, with every store you could imagine under one roof. What makes it even better? You can tie your shopping trip into a visit to the Edinburgh Christmas markets \u2013 it\u2019s all within easy walking distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Buchanan Street in Glasgow is always dressed up beautifully for the holidays, with House of Fraser\u2019s iconic Christmas lights as the highlight. There\u2019s something so magical about wandering down the street with Christmas music playing and the crisp winter air around you. And once you\u2019re done shopping, why not head over to George Square or St Enoch Christmas markets to finish the day with a festive drink?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:19px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Drive-in Movies &amp; Sloan\u2019s EatFilm Christmas Movies<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Drive-in movies at Loch Lomond have become a Christmas tradition for me. I love getting comfy in the car, surrounded by blankets and snacks, while enjoying a festive classic. The food stalls at the drive-in are also a big plus \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the experience! The last Christmas movie I saw was Love Actually, which is always a must-watch during the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another gem for movie lovers is Sloan\u2019s EatFilm Christmas nights in Glasgow. Imagine watching The Holiday in their grand ballroom while tucking into dinner. Their famous mac and cheese paired with a Christmas classic makes for the perfect date night. It&#8217;s a cosy, festive experience that feels truly special, combining great food with the warmth of a holiday movie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:#ddd\" class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-spacer gb-block-spacer gb-divider-solid gb-divider-size-1\"><hr style=\"height:19px\"\/><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enjoy the Festive Season in Scotland<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re wandering through magical markets, enjoying a candlelit concert, or cosying up for a Christmas film, Scotland offers so many wonderful ways to embrace the festive season. There\u2019s something truly special about how the country comes alive at Christmas time, and these are just a few of my favourite ways to experience the magic. If you&#8217;re planning a visit to Scotland during the holidays, make sure to add some of these festive spots to your itinerary \u2013 and let us take care of the driving, so you can sit back and enjoy every moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy holidays!<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8b7941b2-7fff-3c5e-2314-2d8513bc6cbf\"><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"105\" href=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/news\/\">Back to News<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Christmas Lover\u2019s Guide to Scotland: Festive Markets, Candlelit Concerts, and More.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":866,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[112,116,108,119,115,113,109,114,117,121,110,118,120,111],"class_list":["post-862","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","tag-candlelit-concerts-scotland","tag-christmas-chauffeur-service","tag-christmas-in-scotland","tag-christmas-markets-edinburgh","tag-christmas-shopping-edinburgh-glasgow","tag-drive-in-christmas-movies","tag-edinburgh-christmas-markets","tag-festive-activities-scotland","tag-festive-escapes-scotland","tag-glasgow-christmas-lights","tag-scottish-festive-traditions","tag-seasonal-events-in-scotland","tag-winter-attractions-scotland","tag-winter-in-scotland"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.8 -
