I studied History and Literature there at university. Discovering Scotland&#8217;s deep and rich past in <a href=\"https:\/\/edinburgh.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Edinburgh<\/strong><\/a> sparked my love for its history and culture. That passion only deepened as I explored more of the country.  Scotland has so many incredible stories to tell, and I love helping clients discover its rich history and culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Favourite Hidden Gem:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I love to visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scottsabbotsford.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Abbotsford<\/strong><\/a>, in the Scottish Borders. This incredibly unique house was built and lived in by Walter Scott; the interior reflects his tastes and personality with beautiful Gothic design and a vast collection of unique books and curios from the nineteenth century. You can visit his library and even the private study where he completed many of his famous novels. There is a wonderful exhibition about Scott&#8217;s life, a caf\u00e9 overlooking the house and grounds, and some lovely walking routes around the estate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Most Memorable Client Experience:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We received a lovely piece of feedback from a client who highlighted how much they enjoyed their tour with Little&#8217;s. They spoke with such warmth about Scotland and expressed their desire to return soon to explore further. Receiving this feedback and sharing it with the team was fulfilling, knowing we\u2019ve showcased Scotland\u2019s absolute best to our clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Recommendation for First-Time Visitors:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting out of the city and into the Scottish landscape is an absolute must if you can! Scotland&#8217;s scenery is truly enchanting and has to be seen to be believed. If you&#8217;re short on time, a trip to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lochlomond-trossachs.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Loch Lomond<\/strong><\/a> from Glasgow or Edinburgh is a great way to spend a day. You can capture all the best parts of Scotland in this area with the stunning scenery, a stroll around the quaint village of Luss, and even a scenic cruise on the loch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Favourite Scottish Tradition:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no better way to celebrate (and burn calories!) than a proper ceilidh. I danced my first ceilidh at a wedding and now firmly believe that no party is complete without one!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you enjoyed getting to know Lydia and her passion for Scotland. Her insights and experiences are sure to inspire your next adventure in this beautiful country. Whether you&#8217;re planning your first visit or looking for more Scotland travel tips and hidden gems, Scotland always has something magical to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Little&#8217;s, we craft <a href=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/touring\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>bespoke tours<\/strong><\/a> designed just for you. <a href=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/quote\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Get in touch today<\/strong><\/a> and let Lydia bring your dream trip to life!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"105\" href=\"https:\/\/littles.co.uk\/news\/\">Back to News<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join Lydia as she shares her favourite places, traditions, and memorable experiences in Scotland.
